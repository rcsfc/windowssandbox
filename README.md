# windowssandbox
Windows Sandbox config files and launch scripts that execute inside of the sandbox once executed. Can be used standalone or in conjunction with my LinkedIn post here:

# Usage
- Ensure Windows Sandbox is installed on your system (Windows 10/11 Pro only) https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview
- Clone this repo locally. Copy the .WSB files to your Desktop and the .cmd files to the folder you'll be copying inside of the Sandbox.
- Make sure you edit the paths in the .WSB files using your text editor of choice before running them
- Edit the .cmd files to the correct paths for your local system and automate the install of anything you'd like to have pre-installed inside the sandbox
- For the internet-enabled version, if you want to use Elastic Security then make sure you've edited the install string and inserted the corresponding information prior to launching the sandbox
